# word_build_game
In the game; the player is given a chunk of 5 random letters and the aim is to use those letters to form as many words as they can in order to accumulate max points. 
The more the letters used for a word the more the points gained for that word. The number of trials given depends on the maximum possible number of words that can be formed, if 12 then the trials given are  12 + 5; the 5 giving room for wrong guesses
